{; List of organ metadata.
 ; Edit this to add a new organ to the tool. 
 ; Forms may be commented out with #_.
 ; Lines or line tail ends may be commented out with ';'
 ; Syntax is EDN - see definition at https://github.com/edn-format/edn

 ;;
 ; Generalised app-domains. In future we may add :kidney-cancer, :blood-cancer etc.
 ;
 ; If the app only contained one domain of application then the single domain could simply be called :app and could be elided.
 ; The key thing about a domain is that it provides a HOME PAGE for an app, So for transplants, the domain is
 ; related to the organ transplant that is being modelled.
 ;
 ; The main reason we don't simply write a different app for each domain is that this makes it very hard to write
 ; generic application code which applies to all app domains that are all in development at the same time. We'd have to
 ; share code through libraries, and that lengthens the development cycles. 
 ; 
 ; We should protect the integrity of all domains with automated tests. At some point - probably when 
 ; co-development of similar apps stops - we may want to transition to a classic app + local libraries organisation.
 ;
 ; cf. Polylith in the clojure world.
 ;;

 ;; We originally displayed multiple organs in one tool. Now we don't, but so far have retained a vector of organs
 ;; to indicate what is shown. To switch the tool between kidney and lung it is only necessary to switch the keyword
 ;; in the :organ-order vector. 

 :organ-order [:lung]

 ;;
 ; :todo - Check - 
 ; If an app only contains one domain, then the domain selection buttons should be skipped and the app should load 
 ; the domain home page at startup.
 ;
 ; If :organ-order contains more than one organ, then the selector should be present on the home page still. 
 ; [It's debatable whether this option is ever going to be needed, so we may perhaps just require a single organ at startup.]
