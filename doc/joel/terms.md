Hello All,

Further to the points I raised in the meeting, NHSBT will allow the Winton Centre to use NHSBT lung and kidney data in your tools. This is conditional on the following requirements:

The use cases for the data must be clearly outlined by the Winton Centre in writing. These must be completely comprehensive, and any deviation will require further permissions from NHSBT.
Depending on these use cases, we must review the current DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) and see if a new one is needed.
The NHSBT QA (quality assurance) team must be consulted on the use cases (once articulately outlined) and a formal risk assessment must be carried out. There may be assurances required from the Winton Centre in order to reduce risks once the assessment has been carried out.
We must see and formally approve the use of data in the final tool before it goes live
Final approvals on use of the data must be given by the NHSBT Senior Management Team (SMT)

If you have any further questions, please let me know!

Many Thanks,

Joel
