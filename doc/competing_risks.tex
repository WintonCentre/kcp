\section*{Producing multistage survival curves}
DJS 8th October 2020
\begin{itemize}
\item Run a Cox proportional hazards model for each individual cause of leaving the list, removing all other losses as censoring. 
\item For cause $i$ and patient with covariates $x$, we can then estimate a cumulative hazard model $H_i(t , x) = H_{i0}(t) \exp[ a_i ' x]$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $t$ is week post-listing (or this could be done in days if week is not smooth enough)
\item $a_i$ are the estimated log-hazard ratios for the $i$th cause of loss from the waiting list, 
\item  $H_{i0}(t)$ is a smooth model for the cumulative hazard, say through using fractional polynomials.
\item $h_i(t , x)$ is the instantaneous hazard at time $t$, ie the risk of leaving with cause $i$, given still on list at time $t$
\end{itemize}
\item Assuming independent causes of leaving the list, the probability of still being on the list at time $t$ is 
$$ S(t,x) = \exp[ - \sum_i H_i(t , x)].  $$
\item We want to estimate the probability $F_i(t,x)$ of an individual having left the list because of cause $i$ by time $t$, which is what we want to plot.   A loss of type $i$ in time period $t, t+dt$ occurs with probability $  h_i(t , x) S(t,x) dt$, so that 
$$F_i(t,x) = \int h_i(t , x) S(t,x) dt.$$
\item This is not available in closed-form, but can be obtained in discrete time.  Set $S(1,x)=1, F_i(1,x)=0$. Now run through the following steps for $t = 1,2,...$.


\begin{itemize}
\item Assuming a patient is still on the list at the start of week $t$, estimate the probability of a loss of type $i$ as $h_i(t,x) = H_i(t+1 , x) - H_i(t , x) $.  
\item Calculate $p_i(t,x) = h_i(t,x) S(t,x) $ as the probability of leaving the list with cause $i$
\item Add these to form $F_i(t+1,x) = F_i(1,x) + p_i(t,x)$.
\item Set  $S(t+1,x) = S(t,x) - \sum_i p_i(t,x) $
\end{itemize}
\item Then $S(t,x), F_i(t,x)$ will add to 1 and form the bands to be plotted.

\end{itemize}
