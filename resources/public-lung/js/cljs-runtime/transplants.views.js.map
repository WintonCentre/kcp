Because the event of transplant would prevent the event of death on the list/removal from the list from happening, and vice-versa, these Cox Regression models were cause-specific Cox proportional hazard models. When modelling time to transplant, for example, a patient who died on the list at time t would be \u2018censored\u2019 at time t and still considered in the time to transplant modelling cohort but whose time of transplant was \u2018unknown\u2019.

We also made further changes to these models by 1) capping outcome data up to 3 years from listing for all patients in the modelling cohort and 2) removing any risk factors that were no longer statistically significant in both the time to transplant model and the time to death on the list/removal from the list model (p>0.05) and 3) turning all continuous variables into categorical variables.
