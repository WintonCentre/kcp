{; List of organ metadata.
 ; Edit this to add a new organ to the tool. 
 ; Forms may be commented out with #_.
 ; Lines or line tail ends may be commented out with ';'
 ; Syntax is EDN - see definition at https://github.com/edn-format/edn

 ;;
 ; Generalised app-domains. In future we may add :kidney-cancer, :blood-cancer etc.
 ;
 ; If the app only contained one domain of application then the single domain could simply be called :app and could be elided.
 ; The key thing about a domain is that it provides a HOME PAGE for an app, So for transplants, the domain is
 ; related to the organ transplant that is being modelled.
 ;
 ; The main reason we don't simply write a different app for each domain is that this makes it very hard to write
 ; generic application code which applies to all app domains that are all in development at the same time. We'd have to
 ; share code through libraries, and that lengthens the development cycles. 
 ; 
 ; We should protect the integrity of all domains with automated tests. At some point - probably when 
 ; co-development of similar apps stops - we may want to transition to a classic app + local libraries organisation.
 ;
 ; cf. Polylith in the clojure world.
 ;;

 ;; :todo: Rename :organs. Domains?
 :organ-order [:lung :kidney] ; This app will contain the :lung and :kidney home-pages in that order

 ;;
 ; :todo If an app only contains one domain, then the domain selection buttons should be skipped and the app should load 
 ; the domain home page at startup.

 ; this record from excel tools sheets. It pre-dates this metadata file and was used at initialisation
